title: A Personal Containers Marketplace

Personal Containers securely hold all your personal data to help
maintain your privacy and security, and the [current prototype][]
enables that.  However, to liberate the _value_ contained within your
personal data means allowing third-parties access to it somehow, so
that they can provide services, advertising and other value-add.  We
think this is a pretty interesting problem, so we've added an initial
[design note][] with some thoughts on how we might solve it.  Feel
free to pitch in!
