# `dns.me`

<img class="alignright picture" src="/icons/id_card-48.png" />

Big players such as Google and Facebook control online identity, while
users have to do ad-hoc management of their home devices.  Adoption of
recent standards for online identity such as
[OpenID](http://openid.net/) has been very slow.  `dns.me` is building
a one-stop identity server that emphasises ease-of-use and device
integration, but without depending on third-party infrastructure.

Users have to deal with a bewildering array of credentials at many
levels: 3rd party web-sites, local machines and phones, network
connections and VPNs, smartcards. This project asks how we can unify
this into a single personal identity server that can re-export the
information using Internet standards such as DNSSEC, OpenID, and also
provide secure updates. 

The result will enable the user to host their own identity on the
cloud without relying on third-party services such as Google or
Facebook, which currently have the power to arbitrarily snoop or deny
access to users.
