The Personal Containers program is a research project, and we have various projects investigating the impediments towards gaining control of our own personal data. We divide the problem into two halves: firstly how the individual can <i>privately</i> manage their digital data without giving it up to a third-party, and then how they can use <i>public</i> Internet infrastructure to socialise.
