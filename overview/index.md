Personal Containers is a research programme solving the impediments
towards gaining control of our personal data, both *about us*
and *by us*, over our lifetimes.

A complete solution will entail solving a wide range of challenges,
from social to economic to policy, in addition to the technical.  The
infrastructure we are currently building to allow us to meet these
challenges starts from a single very simple premise:

<h4>
  Individuals require control over access to and use of their personal
  data
</h4>

<img class="alignleft picture" src="/graffle/stage1.png" alt="Privacy is paramount" />

Different people will engage with this in different ways and to
different degrees.  By analogy with personal finances, some will
desire very detailed control, auditing and understanding of their data
while others will want only a basic monthly statement describing use.
                                      
Similarly, such *personal* data has stringent privacy requirements:
some will want to minimise exposure of their data by leaving it where
it is collected while others may want to extract and archive all their
data however it is generated.

As a direct result, we support *federation of data sources*, both
local and cloud-hosted, and we provide *interfaces supporting
third-party access to personal data* that is controlled, auditable and
privacy-preserving.

For those interested in the technical details of how we are building
this infrastructure, here are some of the projects we're currently
working on:
