Of course, having all this information locked up securely with no way
to socialise is of little use. The other half of the personal
containers project is investigating how to securely (and crucially,
*easily*) communication with other users without the huge loss of
privacy that we must currently endure. The first project in this space
is the <a href="#appstore">Personal App Store</a>, which is building
an eco-system of data processors, sources and users who can all sell
and consume services without sacrificing privacy. 

One of the great drivers behind social networking has been the
ecosystem of data processors who aggregate and provide services such
as recommendations, location searches, or messaging.  The big
*drawback* to these is that users have to divulge more of their
personal data to the third-party than is necessary, because of the
difficulty of distinguishing what is needed. 

The Personal App Store approaches this problem from another angle: all
user data is treated as immovable (in their possession), and the
third-party applications are instead run inside the users
network. Only aggregated results are sent back to the service company
instead of the raw data. 
Creating this infrastructure and maintaining the same ease-of-use as
centralised services currently provide is a big challenge, but we are
leveraging existing standards such as <a
href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> and emerging technology such as <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/wave/">Apache Wave</a>.
