# Amara

While individuals have a strong incentive to move away from using
cloud services (privacy, long-term archiving, latency), there are a
number of practical difficulties with doing so. 

In the home, the primary issue is management. Cloud services employ
professional administrators to keep their systems running, but this
luxury does not exist in the home network. We have several initiatives
to improve the ease-of-use (the <a href="#homework">Homework</a>
project), robustness (the <a href="#amara">Amara</a> self-healing
operating system) and security (the <a href="#mirage">Mirage</a>
secure programming platform) of our home infrastructure. 

Cloud providers have the luxury of hiring professional system
administrators to ensure their systems are patched and operational. In
the edge network (e.g. in a home router), the end user usually has no
such skills, and errors can be frustrating to diagnose and fix. This
becomes particularly important if we are building a personal cloud
that is more complex than just a single device. 

The Amara distribution is an experimental Linux distro that version
controls everything, from package management (using <a
href="http://nixos.org/nixos/">NixOS</a>) to the data files (using <a
href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>). Having full provenance
information means that updates (especially security-related) can be
speculatively applied and rolled back safely without fear of bringing
the system down.
