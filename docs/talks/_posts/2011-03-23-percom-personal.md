Computing is becoming pervasive. The development of commonly available
platforms has opened ubiquitous computing to a massive and creative
developer base. We see a common application template of smart phone
and cloud computing service, bringing personalized experiences to the
user while companies seek (often desperately!) to monetize the
information derived from the use of the applications. This sharing of
information and co-creation of value is at the heart of the digital
economy, but implementation for ethical companies often hits a privacy
brick wall, while others are blissfully unaware of the privacy
minefield they are walking through. The talk will discuss some of the
issues in personal information sharing, the deep social context in
which this sharing takes place in the real world, present some
challenges for the future in embedding this sharing in technology and
some of our work in this field.
