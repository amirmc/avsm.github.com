As we go about our lives, each of us creates and manages personal
digital data about our online and real-world activities.  Horizon
Digital Economy Research is an RCUK research hub investigating the
many different challenges surrounding collection and exploitation of
these personal contextual footprints.  Currently, many companies
exploit our contextual footprints for their own gain, often without
much explicit understanding or involvement on our part.  Building an
ecosystem around exploitation of our contextual footprints that
maintains acceptable levels of privacy, both when our data is being
exploited individually and as part of a group, is key to enabling
growth in value of our social and personal data.  After introducing
Horizon, I will describe our initial steps toward a system in which we
are trying to enable third parties to compute over personal data while
providing individually acceptable privacy guarantees.
