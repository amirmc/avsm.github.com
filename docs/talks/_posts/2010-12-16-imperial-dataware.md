Modern life involves each of us in the creation and management of
data, and specifically digital data. Data about us is either created
and managed by us (e.g., our address books, email accounts), or by
others (e.g., our health records, bank transactions, loyalty card
activity). Personal Containers is a project investigating how to build
an ecosystem around my data, supporting provision of novel, desirable
applications and services by new and existing businesses. The key
technical problem in supporting an ecology around my data is not one
of containment ("how can I archive all of my data?"). The matter is
complicated by the basic property of digital data, that it can be
infinitely copied without loss of fidelity: once my data escapes my
immediate purview, I cannot easily exercise further control over it;
yet in order to generate significant value from my data, I must allow
others access to it. I will describe our initial steps toward a system
in which we are trying to enable third parties to compute over
personal data while providing individually acceptable privacy
guarantees.
