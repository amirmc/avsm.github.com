"The Consortium catalyzes a Personal Data Ecosystem where individuals
control their own data by enabling a thriving network of businesses
around personal data stores and services. Our three constituency
initiatives: 

- _The Startup Circle_ - for startups committed to putting people in
  control of their own data, open standards and interoperability 
- _Industry Collaborative_ - for existing industries seeking to
  understand opportunities, launch pilot projects and ultimately offer
  services in the ecosystem. 
- _1 Million People for Personal Data_ - gathers people enthusiastic
  about the vision and keen trying out new products and services."
