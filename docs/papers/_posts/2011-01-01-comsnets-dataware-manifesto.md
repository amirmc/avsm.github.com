In this paper we concern ourselves with Service-Oriented
Architectures (SOA) in the "business to consumer" (B2C) arena. In
particular we consider the services required to enable consumers to
combine data they possess with data held about them by businesses and
government. We introduce the concept of Dataware as the logical
federation of data sources containing "my data" and discuss an SOA to
deliver new and compelling services and applications able to reap the
benefits of value-in-use for consumers.
