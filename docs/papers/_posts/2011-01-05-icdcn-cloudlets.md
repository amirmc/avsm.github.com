Current opinion and debate surrounding the capabilities and use of the
Cloud is particularly strident. By contrast, the academic community
has long pursued completely decentralised approaches to service
provision. In this paper we contrast these two extremes, and propose
an architecture, Droplets, that enables a controlled trade-off between
the costs and benefits of each. We also provide indications of
implementation technologies and two simple sample applications that
substantially benefit by exploiting these trade-offs.
